# BBL WiMLDS

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

I've been in charge of organizing them since September 2019 and I had the chance to organize 6 paper reading sessions so far, as well as introducing a good number of papers to our members.

You can find below the list of papers that were discussed during the different sessions.


For each one of these BBLs, you will find
* The paper that was studied
* The slides
* Jupyter hackings if a demo was prepared
