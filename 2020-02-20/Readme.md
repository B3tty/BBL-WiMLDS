# BBL #4

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

The fourth iteration of these BBL took place on the 20th of February 2020. 

The topic of this BBl is this paper: [Inverting The Generator Of A Generative
Adversarial Network (Antonia Creswell and Anil A Bharath)](Resources/reverting_gans.pdf).
