# BBL #2

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

The second edition of these BBL took place on the 17th of October 2019. 

The topic of this BBl is this paper: [Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification](Resources/gender_shades.pdf).

The slides used for the session are [here](slides).
