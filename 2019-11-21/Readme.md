# BBL #3

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

The third iteration of these BBL took place on the 21st of November 2019. 

The topic of this BBl is this paper: [Uncovering Bias in Ad Feedback Data Analyses & Applications](Resources/adfeedback.pdf).

[Cecile Della Valle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c%C3%A9cile-della-valle-7109b212b/) also introduced the paper [Deep Unfolding of a Proximal Interior Point Method for Image Restoration](Resources/deepunfolding.pdf).
