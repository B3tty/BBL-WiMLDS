# BBL #7

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

The seventh edition of these paper sessions took place on the 26th of May 2020.
 
Two papers were presented during this session:

* [Juliette Tisseyre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliettetisseyre) presented [SynSin: End-to-end View Synthesis from a Single Image (Olivia Wiles, Georgia Gkioxari et al)](Resources/synsin.pdf).

  Slides can be found [here]().


* I presented [How can they know that? A study of factors affecting the creepiness of recommendations (Helma Torkamaan, Catalin-Mihai Barbu, JÃ¼rgen Ziegler)](Resources/creepiness.pdf).

  Slides can be found [here](slides).
