# BBL WiMLDS

WiMLDS Paris is launching a new format: paper reading sessions. These sessions will happen at lunchtime, each 3rd Thursday of the month. The goal of these events is to take some time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we found interesting, and take the opportunity to discover ML-passionate people in Paris.


For each one of these BBLs, you will find
* On GitHub:
  * A pdf version of the slides
  * Jupyter hackings if a demo was prepared
* On [Medium](https://medium.com/@WiMLDS_Paris):
  * A summary article with a slide show

## Sessions

* [BBL #1](2019-09-19/Readme.md): Learning Embeddings for Product Size Recommendations
