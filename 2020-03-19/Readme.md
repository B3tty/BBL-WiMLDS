# BBL #5

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

The fifth iteration of these BBL took place on the 19th of March 2020. 

Two papers were presented during this session:

* [Marie Sacksick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marie-sacksick) introduced [An Active Learning Approach for Reducing Annotation Cost in Skin Lesion Analysis](Resources/active_learning.pdf)
* [CraftAssist Instruction Parsing: Semantic Parsing for a Minecraft Assistant](Resources/craftassist.pdf)
