# BBL #1

WiMLDS Paris is launching a new format: paper reading sessions. These sessions will happen at lunchtime, each 3rd Thursday of the month. The goal of these events is to take some time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we found interesting, and take the opportunity to discover ML-passionate people in Paris.

The first iteration of these BBL takes place on the 19th of September 2019. 

The topic of this BBl is this paper: [Learning Embeddings for Product Size Recommendations](https://bit.ly/2Z88rff)
