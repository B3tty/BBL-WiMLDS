# BBL WiMLDS

Each 3rd Thursday of the month, WiMLDS (Women in Machine Learning and Data Science) is holding a Brown Bag Lunch around a specific research paper, and holding group discussions on the adjacent topics.

For each one of these BBLs, you will find
* On GitHub:
  * A pdf version of the slides
  * Jupyter hackings if a demo was prepared
* On [Medium](https://medium.com/@WiMLDS_Paris):
  * A summary article with a slide show
