# BBL #6

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

The sixth edition of these paper sessions took place on the 16th of April 2020.
 
Two papers were presented during this session:

* [Maroua Maachou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maroua-maachou-332238153) presented [Attention Is All You Need](Resources/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf)
