# BBL #8

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

The eight edition of these paper sessions took place on the 18th of June 2020.
 
Two papers were presented during this session:

* I presented [Fake News Detection Using a Blend of Neural Networks: An Application of Deep Learning (Aman Agarwal, Mamta Mittal, et al)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-020-00165-4)

  Slides can be found [here](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/E2gyHyVsjyAf0I).


* [Farah Dhouib](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farahdhouib/) presented [Towards Robust Deep Neural Networks for Affect and Depression Recognition (Emna Rejaibi, Daoud Kadoch, et al)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00310).
