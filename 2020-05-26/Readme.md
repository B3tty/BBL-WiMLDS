# BBL #7

These sessions are an initiative by the [WiMLDS Paris meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science). Each 3rd Thursday of the month, during lunchtime, we take the time to discuss Machine Learning and Data Science papers that we have found interesting. It's also a good opportunity to meet ML-passionate people in Paris.

The seventh edition of these paper sessions took place on the 26th of May 2020.
 
Two papers were presented during this session:

* [Juliette Tisseyre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliettetisseyre) presented []().

  Slides can be found [here]().


* I presented [The Influence of Personal Values on Music Taste: Towards Value-Based Music Recommendations](Resources/music_reco.pdf).

  Slides can be found [here](slides).
